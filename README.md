# Lab 5a Repository

This repository contains the files that teams will use to complete Lab 5a, in which they perform formal code inspections of the five code blocks in the `code_blocks` directory. The goal of this lab is to practice the code inspection process and to identify potential issues in the code blocks.

Please see the Lab 5a instructions for more details on the code inspection process and the specific tasks to be completed.
